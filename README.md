  Hello and Welcome!<br>
  The purpose of this repository is to store and show off the website I had built for North Carolina's Future Business Leaders of America.<br>
  I had built this website using a mix of HTML and CSS elements.<br><br>
  <h1>Index.html</h1><br>
  The Index is used for the front page of the website taht allows you to see the business and whats offered as well as have the ability to go to the jobs page.<br>
  <h1>Jobs.html</h1><br>
  Jobs was used for the page that held information such as what jobs where available as well as what the position offers in oppertunities and duties.
  <h1>logo.png</h1><br>
  logo is an image made using AI as well as being touched up by myself. It was used on the webpage as the companies logo.
  <h1>Openpos.html</h1>
  Openpos was a webpage that was planted within the jobs webpage that showed the current open job positions within the company.
